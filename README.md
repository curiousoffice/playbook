# Playbook

We realized that we needed to divide our forces in order to build a great company.

One of our core principles is *always aim high*, and to be consequent we need to have demanding objectives:
* Hire the best people
* Work for the best companies
* Craft the best software
* Build something that people love

We created specialized workgroups that strive to achieve those goals by defining universal guidelines and ensuring they are always applied.

## Squads

The current squads -classified by objective- are:

* Hire the best people
 * Recruitment squad
* Work for the best companies
 * Sales squad
* Craft the best software
 * Code Analysis squad
 * Deployment squad
 * Methodologies squad
 * Product Design / UX squad
 * Testing squad
 * Security squad
 * Software Design squad
* Build something that people love
 * Research & Innovation squad

In addition, we need to support sophilabs infrastructure and operations:

## Workflow

Every squad follows the same workflow (M.A.P.E.D.):
̨
1. **Measure** teams and projects on different areas
2. **Analyze** measurements in order to detect the underlying issues and areas of improvements
3. **Propose** changes and design an acton plan considering different scenarios
4. **Ensure** the action plan is executed and help solving stoppers
5. **Document** lessons learned and how the plan affected the measurements
5. Go to 1.
