Hello Sophilaber
================

This is the team’s playbook, your playbook.

You will find here how you and your teammates should run our software consulting
company, and the tools and practices that should guide us to create quality
software products.

This document is in a continuous development process and you are a key player
to make it evolve. Please contribute to it using `this repo
<https://git.sophilabs.io/sophilabs/playbook>`_.

Principles
==========

We've learned from our experience that working with people that share the
correct set of principles is the foundation for creating highly productive
teams.

**Aim high** and encourage everyone else to outstand above the average.

**Look into the details**, a great product is the sum of perfectly well thought
details.

**Practice impersonation** helping pursuing other people’s goals as if they
were yours.

**Be Honest**, never sacrifice honesty for politeness.

**Love your craft** and strive to transcend through your creations.

Culture
=======

Our main objective is to be an outstanding team of designers and engineers so
we will eliminate or simplify any policy that makes us diverge from that goal.
Most of the time you won’t find a policy, we encourage you to "use your best
judgement".

We avoid departments and prefer just a few hierarchies. We like composition of
roles necessary for projects and company objectives over inheritance of bosses
and direct reports.

We avoid having private conversations about each other or clients. Instead, we
talk in person, and use tools such as Slack, JIRA and GitLab to communicate
openly within a project, within sophilabs, and publicly.

We prefer open offices where everyone sees each other encouraging people to
collaborate spontaneously but keeping always a quiet environment, we say “work
comfortably but keeping the stillness of a library”. There are many places for
entertainment when you need to rest your head without disturbing your teammates.

Our standards are very high, and bringing on a new team member requires a "yes"
from everyone who participated in the interview process. Therefore, we expect
the best from each other, give each other the benefit of the doubt, and
encourage each other to take initiative to improve ourselves and the company.

Except for a few roles with pure management responsibilities, everybody at
sophilabs must dedicate at least part-time on programming software, on a
customer project, on internal tools or for the Research and Innovation
working group.

Time
====

We work a `sustainable pace<http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/overtime.html>`_.
From March to December we dedicate two days per
month as “investment days”, and one day during January and February. We
typically distribute investment days in the team in order to have at least one
member dedicated to the project everyday.
If a team member is absent from client work because of illness or study
holidays, we'll use investment days as extra client days to avoid slipping
behind schedule.

When taking time off during client work, we discuss how it will impact the
schedule with other team members.
Sending off-hours communication may create an unintended sense of urgency with
the recipients of your message. Try to avoid creating that urgency when
possible.
Unless actually urgent, you may ignore off-hours messages which you receive and
handle them once you are back at work.

Consulting
----------

Our main business is consulting projects. Those projects start with sales and
go through a normal flow of designing, developing, shipping, monitoring, and
iterating. We should do such a good job for our clients that they will want to
poach us, and be such a great place to work that we can be confident our
teammates won't leave.

Investment
----------

Investment days are days for investment in ourselves, our company, and our
community. Primarily this means doing something that interests us like
defining best practices, investigating a new framework, contributing to open
source, writing a blog post, attending community events, or reading an
educational book. The goal is to encourage individuals to improve and share
their knowledge with the rest of the team.

The time you invest during these days must generate value, in different forms:

- Pick from or contribute back to guidelines and playbook
- Completing squads’ pre-defined tickets
- Contributing or creating open source software
- Writing a blog post
- Explore change to tools and processes on the "R&I" JIRA project
- Work on conference and meetup talks and proposals
- Work on Sophia or other internal projects

There is a difference between a normal investment day, and extended downtime
between client projects (being “on bench”).

Extended periods of time between client projects should skew heavily towards
revenue generating activities. This could be working on existing revenue
generating products and services, networking and sales, or creating something
new that will generate revenue.

Because this extended time period will go away when you resume client work, and
because we can't sustain non-revenue generating activities for long, approach
this extended time between client projects with a sense of urgency.
Validating ideas, shipping, and getting to revenue generation as quickly as
possible should be a priority. We shouldn't go weeks without results to show,
and we should impose the same constraints and process as we do on client
projects.

Laptop
======

MacBook Pro
-----------

Every person that joins Sophilabs receives a MacBook Pro latest generation.
These laptops are known for their performance, robustness, great look & feel
and battery life, but for us, the most important feature is that they allow us
building and testing apps on any platform: OSX, Linux and Windows.

Text Editor/IDE
---------------

Plain text won't become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and simplifies
debugging and testing. The editor should be an extension of your hand; make
sure your editor is configurable, extensible, and programmable. -The Pragmatic
Programmer

We encourage everyone to be an expert using his favorite programming tool. Know
every shortcut and automate repetitive tasks to gain more productivity so you
can focus on building the software the way we want.

Technology
==========

Early in a project, we have to decide which platforms we'll use.
Which platform depends on our ideas for solving the users' problems. For
example, if they're construction workers on a job site, a mobile or tablet
interface might be the best choice.

After considering what's best for users, what's best for us?

- The tools are open source with a strong community
- The tools make us happy
- The tools help us create and iterate quickly

Web Apps
--------

In our experience, teams using the `Django framework<https://git.sophilabs.io/sophilabs/playbook>`_
can bring products to market more quickly and with a lower total cost of
ownership than other tools. There's also strong overlap between the agile and
Python communities, which means (among things) that Python developers tend to
write adaptable modules, write tests and avoid repeated code.

In addition to Python, we use other open source software and web standards such
as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UNIX and Postgres because they:

- Are high quality.
- Avoid vendor lock-in.
- Provide flexibility to switch components.
- Work on many devices.
- Are battle-tested.
- Have few bugs when seen by many eyes.

Django comes with features that decrease the burden on the programmer to protect
against security attacks such as:

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- SQL injection
- Header injection


Methodology
===========

The Agile way
-------------

We adhere to the `Agile Manifesto principles
<http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html>`_, declaring that our highest
priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of
valuable software.
We welcome changing requirements, even late in development as we understand that
agile processes must harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

We say that working software is the primary measure of progress, and to be
consequent we deliver working software frequently, from a week to a couple of
weeks, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and
users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely and must work
together daily throughout the project.

At regular intervals, we reflect on how to become more effective, then
tune and adjust our behavior accordingly. We look for a motivating environment
and culture, where everybody trusts each other to receive constructive feedback
and get the job done.

We strongly believe that continuous attention to details and technical
excellence enhances agility. And Simplicity --the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done-- is essential, at every level.

In our experience we have seen that the best architectures, requirements, and
designs emerge from self-organizing teams that truly understands these
principles, if you believe there are better ways to build good software we would
love to hear from you.

Squads
======

We realized that we needed to divide our forces in order to build a
great company.

One of our core principles is *always aim high*, and to be consequent we
need to have demanding objectives:

* Hire the best people
* Work for the best companies
* Craft the best software
* Build something that people love

We created specialized workgroups that strive to achieve those goals by
defining universal guidelines and ensuring they are always applied.

The current squads -classified by objective- are:

-  Hire the best people
 -  Recruitment squad
-  Work for the best companies
 -  Sales squad
-  Craft the best software
 -  Code Analysis squad
 -  Deployment squad
 -  Methodologies squad
 -  Product Design / UX squad
 -  Testing squad
 -  Security squad
 -  Software Design squad
-  Build something that people love
 -  Research & Innovation squad

In addition, we need to support sophilabs infrastructure and operations:

- Infrastructure squad

How it works
------------

Workflow
~~~~~~~~

Every squad follows the same workflow (M.A.P.E.D.):

1. **M** easure teams and projects on different areas
2. **A** nalyze measurements in order to detect the underlying issues and areas of improvements
3. **P** ropose changes and design an action plan considering different scenarios
4. **E** nsure the action plan is executed and help solving stoppers
5. **D** ocument lessons learned and how the plan affected the measurements
6. Go to 1.

Metrics
~~~~~~~

The squads define their own objectives and principles.
In order to measure performance on different projects,
metrics are needed. We use automated tools to measure quantifiable metrics and
quizzes that we distribute periodically to teams and customers to measure
opinionated metrics.

Facing
^^^^^^

There are negative metrics (higher is worst) and positive metrics (higher
is better).
The ones marked with ▲ are positive, the others marked with ▼ are negative.

Types
^^^^^

Some squads define multiple metrics for the same principle/objective. For those
scenarios, primary and secondary metrics are defined, primary metrics are shown
in the dashboard, while secondary metrics are shown in the detailed view of
each project.

Primary metrics are identified in this document in bold text.

Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~

Customers can see the status of their projects by visiting
`dashboard.sophilabs.io <https://dashboard.sophilabs.io>`_

There are also TVs distributed all around our offices that show the status of
each metric for every project.

This adds true visibility and make everybody feel the responsibility of
improving things.

Code Analysis Squad
-------------------

Principles
~~~~~~~~~~
- **Simplicity** : Minimize the effort required to understand a given source
  code.
- **Consistency** : Apply the same practices along the project and across
  similar projects.
- **Legibility** : The ability to understand the code at a statement level.
- **Scalability** : The activity of writing performant code at a statement-level.
- **Reusability** : The ability of a given piece of code to be reused in other
  projects without modification.

Objectives
~~~~~~~~~~
- Produce knowledge about code quality that can be applied to existing and new
  projects. This knowledge must be documented and only cover programming
  languages being used in Sophilabs. Examples include: guidelines, linting
  rules, workflows, conventions, etc. These documents won’t only refer to code,
  but also to how to ensure code quality (e.g. code reviews).
- Develop a plan or methodology to measure the effectiveness of the generated
  knowledge.
- Develop or improve tools that automate and control the quality of the code
  (linters, conventions, etc). This tools and documents must be Open Source.
- Adjust guidelines, workflows and other procedures to the needs of each project.


Metrics

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- # linter errors per 1000 lines of code

Code complexity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- avg # of conditionals per method/function
- avg # of LoC per method/function
- avg # of methods per class
- avg # of arguments per function/method
- avg # of nesting levels
