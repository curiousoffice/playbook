# Objectives

The goal of the Methodologies squad is to ensure that the software development processes used on different projects meet the following principles.

### Adaptability
The team is able to quickly adapt to unexpected changes.

### Productivity
The rate of output of the team is above the average.

### Transparency
The team is traceable and all documents and resources are accessible.

### Satisfaction
Team, client and stake holders are happy.

### Integration
Team and client are involved in the project.

# Workflow

Every squad follows the same workflow (M.A.P.E.D.):

1. **Measure** teams and projects on different areas
2. **Analyze** measurements in order to detect the underlying issues and areas of improvements
3. **Propose** changes and design an acton plan considering different scenarios
4. **Ensure** the action plan is executed and help solving stoppers
5. **Document** lessons learned and how the plan affected the measurements
5. Go to 1.

# Metrics

Metrics are going to be measured taking one month of work. These are the metrics designed by the squad, classified by principle.

## Adaptability
* \# different web and mobile technologies the team used
* \# requirement specification meetings with Product Owner/Customer
* \# releases to production / total hours invested by the team

## Productivity
* estimated time / invested time
* 1 / \# change requests on features released less than a week ago

## Transparency
* \# tickets with size > 8 (enormous)
* \# tickets not tracked in the tool
* total invested hours / invested hours on project without a ticket

## Integration
* \# status meetings
* \# retrospective meetings
* 1 / \# communication issues TBD
* Are roles documented? TBD
* Are communication channels correctly defined? TBD

## Satisfaction
* Survey with the following questions:
 * Adaptability
 * Productivity
 * Transparency
 * Integration
 * Organization
