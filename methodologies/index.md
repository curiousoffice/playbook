# Objectives

The goal of the Methodologies squad is to ensure that the development processes used on different projects meet the following principles.

### Adaptability
The team is able to quickly adapt to unexpected changes.

### Productivity
The rate of output of the team is above the average.

### Transparency
The team is traceable and all documents and resources are accessible.

### Satisfaction
Team, client and stake holders are happy.

### Integration
Everybody is involved in the project.

# Workflow

Every squad follows the same workflow (M.A.P.E.D.):

1. **Measure** teams and projects on different areas
2. **Analyze** measurements in order to detect the underlying issues and areas of improvements
3. **Propose** changes and design an acton plan considering every project
4. **Ensure** the action plan is executed and help solving stoppers if found
5. **Document** lessons learned and how the plan affected the measurements
5. Go to 1.

# Metrics

Metrics are going to be measured taking one month of work
These are the metrics designed by the squad, classified by principle

## Adaptability
* \# different technologies the team knows
* \# requirement specification meetings with Product Owner/Customer
* \# releases to production

## Productivity
* estimated time / invested time
* \# change requests on features released less than a week ago

## Transparency

* \# tickets with estimated time > X
* \# status meetings
* \# tickets ‘paused’ because of a priority change
* \# tickets not tracked in the tool

## Integration
* Are roles documented?
* Are communication channels correctly defined?
* \# retrospective meetings

## Satisfaction
* Survey with the following questions:
 * Adaptability
 * Productivity
 * Transparency
 * Integration
 * Organization
